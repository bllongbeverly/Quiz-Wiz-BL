# Quiz-Wiz-BL

## Description

The Quiz-Wiz is a project challenge for creating a fun game from no starter code.  I was able to create a coding quiz game on the internet that is reactive and has a timer that counts down from 60 seconds and if you answer the question in-correctly it deducts 15 seconds from the timer for each wrong answer.

## Installation

GitHub, GitBash, Windows 10

## Usage
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
